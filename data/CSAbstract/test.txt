background	While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown a great success in single-label image classification, it is important to note that real world images generally contain multiple labels, which could correspond to different objects, scenes, actions and attributes in an image.
background	Traditional approaches to multi-label image classification learn independent classifiers for each category and employ ranking or thresholding on the classification results.
method	These techniques, although working well, fail to explicitly exploit the label dependencies in an image.
method	In this paper, we utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address this problem.
method	Combined with CNNs, the proposed CNN-RNN framework learns a joint image-label embedding to characterize the semantic label dependency as well as the image-label relevance, and it can be trained end-to-end from scratch to integrate both information in a unified framework.
result	Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art multi-label classification models.

background	Biologists depend on visual representations, and their use of diagrams has drawn the attention of philosophers, historians, and sociologists interested in understanding how these images are involved in biological reasoning.
background	These studies, however, proceed from identification of diagrams on the basis of their spare visual appearance, and do not draw on a foundational theory of the nature of diagrams as representations.
background	This approach has limited the extent to which we understand how these diagrams are involved in biological reasoning.
objective	In this paper I characterize three different kinds of figures among those previously identified as diagrams.
objective	The features that make these figures distinctive as representational types, furthermore, illuminate the ways in which they are involved in biological reasoning.

background	Mobile robots with reconfigurable chassis are able to traverse unstructured outdoor environments with boulders or rubble, and overcome challenging structures in urban environments, like stairs or steps.
background	Autonomously traversing rough terrain and such obstacles while ensuring the safety of the robot is a challenging task in mobile robotics.
objective	In this paper we introduce a two-phase motion planning algorithm for actively reconfigurable tracked robots.
method	We first use the completeness of a graph search on a regular grid to quickly find an initial path in a low dimensional space, considering only the platform's operating limits instead of the complete state.
method	We then take this initial path to focus the RRT* search in the continuous high-dimensional state space including the actuators of the robot.
method	We do not rely on a detailed structure/terrain classification or use any predefined motion sequences.
method	Hence, our planner can be applied to urban structures, like stairs, as well as rough unstructured environments.
result	Simulation results prove our method to be effective in solving planning queries in such environments.

background	Backtracting is a well-known technique for solving combinatorial problems.
background	It is of interest to programming methodologists because (1) correctness of backtracking programs may be difficult to ascertain experimentally and (2) efficiency is often of paramount importance.
background	This paper applies a programming methodology, which we call control structure abstraction, to the backtracking technique.
method	The value of control structure abstraction in the context of correctness is that proofs of general properties of a class of programs with similar control structures are separated from proofs of specific properties of individual programs of the class.
method	In the context of efficiency, it provides sufficient conditions for correctness of an initial program which may subsequently be improved for efficiency while preserving correctness.

objective	In this paper we address the problem of semantic labeling of indoor scenes on RGB-D data.
method	With the availability of RGB-D cameras, it is expected that additional depth measurement will improve the accuracy.
method	Here we investigate a solution how to incorporate complementary depth information into a semantic segmentation framework by making use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
method	Recently encoder-decoder type fully convolutional CNN architectures have achieved a great success in the field of semantic segmentation.
method	Motivated by this observation we propose an encoder-decoder type network, where the encoder part is composed of two branches of networks that simultaneously extract features from RGB and depth images and fuse depth features into the RGB feature maps as the network goes deeper.
result	Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed fusion-based architecture achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging SUN RGB-D benchmark obtaining 76.27% global accuracy, 48.30% average class accuracy and 37.29% average intersectionover-union score.

background	It is no secret that pornographic material is now a one-clickaway from everyone, including children and minors.
background	General social media networks are striving to isolate adult images and videos from normal ones.
background	Intelligent image analysis methods can help to automatically detect and isolate questionable images in media.
background	Unfortunately, these methods require vast experience to design the classifier including one or more of the popular computer vision feature descriptors.
method	We propose to build a classifier based on one of the recently flourishing deep learning techniques.
method	Convolutional neural networks contain many layers for both automatic features extraction and classification.
method	The benefit is an easier system to build (no need for hand-crafting features and classifiers).
result	Additionally, our experiments show that it is even more accurate than the state of the art methods on the most recent benchmark dataset.

background	Modern charging systems use user, network, and service related information when performing online charging.
background	Compared, however, to the overall information available and used in network management processes as a whole, charging systems only use a limited subset.
objective	This work is motivated by the challenge to identify which information is used, and how it is used in online charging related processes, and also to explore whether it could be utilized “better” or “smarter” to improve future online charging systems functionality.
objective	We do not attempt to predict which information will be utilized in such systems and for what purpose, but instead we summarize open issues in view of the emerging trend of exploiting the user, network and service related information in service provisioning.
method	We focus on the latest 3GPP standards and review relevant research papers, and propose three key aspects of online charging, with respect to information utilization: a) signaling aspect, b) inter-domain aspect, and c) serviceand component-based aspect.
method	We present a state of the art review by grouping the works found in the literature based on the aspects they are associated with, and compare them based on proposed comparison criteria.
result	The discussion presented at the end of the paper indicates three common open issues, namely: 1) lack of common charging information specification and structure, 2) lack of mechanisms for information sharing between stakeholders in the service delivery process, and 3) lack of a common framework for sharing information while protecting user privacy.

background	The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plays a significant role in patient care, especially at the early stage, because the consciousness of the severity and the progression risks allows the patients to take prevention measures before irreversible brain damages are shaped.
background	Although many studies have applied machine learning methods for computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) of AD recently, a bottleneck of the diagnosis performance was shown in most of the existing researches, mainly due to the congenital limitations of the chosen learning models.
method	In this study, we design a deep learning architecture, which contains stacked auto-encoders and a softmax output layer, to overcome the bottleneck and aid the diagnosis of AD and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
method	Compared to the previous workflows, our method is capable of analyzing multiple classes in one setting, and requires less labeled training samples and minimal domain prior knowledge.
result	A significant performance gain on classification of all diagnosis groups was achieved in our experiments.

background	Human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive.
background	Human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that can not be reused.

background	Based on the real data of a Chinese commercial bank’s credit card, in this paper, we classify the credit card customers into four classifications by K-means.
method	Then we built forecasting models separately based on four data mining methods such as C5.0, neural network, chi-squared automatic interaction detector, and classification and regression tree according to the background information of the credit cards holders.
method	Conclusively, we obtain some useful information of decision tree regulation by the best model among the four.
result	The information is not only helpful for the bank to understand related characteristics of different customers, but also marketing representatives to find potential customers and to implement target marketing.

objective	This study investigates self-presentation strategies among online dating participants, exploring how participants manage their online presentation of self in order to accomplish the goal of finding a romantic partner.
background	Thirty-four individuals active on a large online dating site participated in telephone interviews about their online dating experiences and perceptions.
method	Qualitative data analysis suggests that participants attended to small cues online, mediated the tension between impression management pressures and the desire to present an authentic sense of self through tactics such as creating a profile that reflected their "ideal self," and attempted to establish the veracity of their identity claims.
result	This study provides empirical support for Social Information Processing theory in a naturalistic context while offering insight into the complicated way in which "honesty" is enacted online.

background	The widespread deployment and adoption of the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard is making Internet video-on-demand a `standard' Internet application similar in impact as email and web browsing.
background	While video streaming has been widely deployed and studied for decades, DASH-based streaming is very different as it involves adaptation both by the application and by TCP.
background	The dynamics and implications of multiple levels of end-to-end congestion control are not well understood.
objective	The contribution of the research presented in this paper is twofold: first, we characterize the bandwidth consumption of a widely deployed DASH application (i.e., Netflix); second, we provide insight in how different implementations and different access networks can impact bandwidth consumption.
result	Our results suggest that Netflix adaptation defaults to underlying TCP mechanisms during periods of heavy, sustained network congestion.
result	However, the application algorithm is clearly intertwined with the underlying TCP mechanisms during periods of volatile network conditions.
result	In one network scenario, we observed that a backlogged TCP flow achieved a throughput of 6 Mbps while a Netflix session (under similar path conditions) consumed less than 3 Mbps of bandwidth.

background	The e-commerce literature has rarely addressed the measurement of customer perceptions of website service quality in digital marketing environments.
background	It is argued that the current SERVQUAL and IS-SERVQUAL instruments need to be refined and validated to fit the digital marketing environment, as they are targeted primarily towards either traditional retailing or information systems contexts.
objective	This article validates and refines a comprehensive model and instrument for measuring customer-perceived service quality of websites that market digital products and services.
method	After a discussion of the conceptualization and operationalization of the service quality construct, the procedure used in modifying items, collecting data, and validating a multiple-item scale is described.
method	Subsequently, evidence of reliability and validity on the basis of analyzing data from a quota sample of 260 adult respondents is presented.
method	Implications for practice and research are then explored.
result	Finally, this paper concludes by discussing limitations that could be addressed in future studies.
result	The final EC-SERVQUAL instrument with good reliability and validity will be essential to the development and testing of e-business theories, and provide researchers with a common framework for explaining, justifying, and comparing differences across results.

background	This study examines the agenda-setting power of fake news and fact-checkers who fight them through a computational look at the online mediascape from 2014 to 2016.
background	Although our study confirms that content from fake news websites is increasing, these sites do not exert excessive power.
background	Instead, fake news has an intricately entwined relationship with online partisan media, both responding and setting its issue agenda.
background	In 2016, partisan media appeared to be especially susceptible to the agendas of fake news, perhaps due to the election.
background	Emerging news media are also responsive to the agendas of fake news, but to a lesser degree.
background	Fake news coverage itself is diverging and becoming more autonomous topically.
background	While fact-checkers are autonomous in their selection of issues to cover, they were not influential in determining the agenda of news media overall, and their influence appears to be declining, illustrating the difficulties factcheckers face in disseminating their corrections.

background	Virtual Reality (VR) is starting to be used in psychological therapy around the world.
background	However, a thorough understanding of the reason why VR is effective and what effect it has on the human psyche is still missing.
background	Most research on this subject is related to the concept of presence.
objective	This paper gives an up-to-date overview of research in this diverse field.
method	It starts with the most prevailing definitions and theories on presence, most of which attribute special roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space.
method	A review of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the relationship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli.
method	An investigation shows there has been substantial research for developing methods for measuring presence and research regarding factors that contribute to presence.
result	Knowledge of these contributing factors can play a vital role in development of new VR applications, but key knowledge elements in this area are still missing.

background	Clustering is often an essential first step in data mining intended to reduce redundancy, or define data categories.
background	Hierarchical clustering, a widely used clustering technique, can offer a richer representation by suggesting the potential group structures.
background	However, parallelization of such an algorithm is challenging as it exhibits inherent data dependency during the hierarchical tree construction.
method	In this paper, we design a parallel implementation of Single-linkage Hierarchical Clustering by formulating it as a Minimum Spanning Tree problem.
method	We further show that Spark is a natural fit for the parallelization of single-linkage clustering algorithm due to its natural expression of iterative process.

background	We propose an efficient method to generate white-box adversarial examples to trick a character-level neural classifier.
background	We find that only a few manipulations are needed to greatly decrease the accuracy.
method	Our method relies on an atomic flip operation, which swaps one token for another, based on the gradients of the onehot input vectors.
method	Due to efficiency of our method, we can perform adversarial training which makes the model more robust to attacks at test time.
result	With the use of a few semantics-preserving constraints, we demonstrate that HotFlip can be adapted to attack a word-level classifier as well.

background	The standard training regime for transition-based dependency parsers makes use of an oracle, which predicts an optimal transition sequence for a sentence and its gold tree.
method	We present an improved oracle for the arc-eager transition system, which provides a set of optimal transitions for every valid parser configuration, including configurations from which the gold tree is not reachable.
method	In such cases, the oracle provides transitions that will lead to the best reachable tree from the given configuration.
method	The oracle is efficient to implement and provably correct.
method	We use the oracle to train a deterministic left-to-right dependency parser that is less sensitive to error propagation, using an online training procedure that also explores parser configurations resulting from non-optimal sequences of transitions.
result	This new parser outperforms greedy parsers trained using conventional oracles on a range of data sets, with an average improvement of over 1.2 LAS points and up to almost 3 LAS points on some data sets.

background	In this paper, we proposed a sentence encoding-based model for recognizing text entailment.
objective	In our approach, the encoding of sentence is a two-stage process.
method	Firstly, average pooling was used over word-level bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM) to generate a firststage sentence representation.
method	Secondly, attention mechanism was employed to replace average pooling on the same sentence for better representations.
method	Instead of using target sentence to attend words in source sentence, we utilized the sentence’s first-stage representation to attend words appeared in itself, which is called ”Inner-Attention” in our paper .
result	Experiments conducted on Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus has proved the effectiveness of ”Inner-Attention” mechanism.
result	With less number of parameters, our model outperformed the existing best sentence encoding-based approach by a large margin.

background	Predicting the final state of a running process, the remaining time to completion or the next activity of a running process are important aspects of runtime process management.
background	Runtime management requires the ability to identify processes that are at risk of not meeting certain criteria in order to offer case managers decision information for timely intervention.
background	This in turn requires accurate prediction models for process outcomes and for the next process event, based on runtime information available at the prediction and decision point.
objective	In this paper, we describe an initial application of deep learning with recurrent neural networks to the problem of predicting the next process event.
method	This is both a novel method in process prediction, which has previously relied on explicit process models in the form of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) or annotated transition systems, and also a novel application for deep learning methods.

background	Single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) which utilizes single carrier modulation at the transmitter and frequency domain equalization at the receiver is a technique that has similar performance and essentially the same overall structure as those of an OFDMA system.
background	One prominent advantage over OFDMA is that the SC-FDMA signal has lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).
background	SC-FDMA has drawn great attention as an attractive alternative to OFDMA, especially in the uplink communications where lower PAPR greatly benefits the mobile terminal in terms of transmit power efficiency.

background	The core component of most modern trackers is a discriminative classifier, tasked with distinguishing between the target and the surrounding environment.
background	To cope with natural image changes, this classifier is typically trained with translated and scaled sample patches.
background	Such sets of samples are riddled with redundancies—any overlapping pixels are constrained to be the same.
objective	Based on this simple observation, we propose an analytic model for datasets of thousands of translated patches.
method	By showing that the resulting data matrix is circulant, we can diagonalize it with the discrete Fourier transform, reducing both storage and computation by several orders of magnitude.
method	Interestingly, for linear regression our formulation is equivalent to a correlation filter, used by some of the fastest competitive trackers.
method	For kernel regression, however, we derive a new kernelized correlation filter (KCF), that unlike other kernel algorithms has the exact same complexity as its linear counterpart.
method	Building on it, we also propose a fast multi-channel extension of linear correlation filters, via a linear kernel, which we call dual correlation filter (DCF).
method	Both KCF and DCF outperform top-ranking trackers such as Struck or TLD on a 50 videos benchmark, despite running at hundreds of frames-per-second, and being implemented in a few lines of code (Algorithm 1).
method	To encourage further developments, our tracking framework was made open-source.

background	Deep learning methods for 3D human pose estimation from RGB images require a huge amount of domain-specific labeled data for good in-the-wild performance.
background	However, obtaining annotated 3D pose data requires a complex motion capture setup which is generally limited to controlled settings.
method	We propose a semi-supervised learning method using a structure-aware loss function which is able to utilize abundant 2D data to learn 3D information.
method	Furthermore, we present a simple temporal network which uses additional context present in pose sequences to improve and temporally harmonize the pose estimates.
result	Our complete pipeline improves upon the state-of-the-art by 11.8%, and works at 30 FPS on a commodity graphics card.

background	Attention based neural network models have been successfully applied in answer selection, which is an important subtask of question answering (QA).
background	These models often represent a question by a single vector and find its corresponding matches by attending to candidate answers.
background	However, questions and answers might be related to each other in complicated ways which cannot be captured by single-vector representations.
objective	In this paper, we propose Multihop Attention Networks (MAN) which aim to uncover these complex relations for ranking question and answer pairs.
method	Unlike previous models, we do not collapse the question into a single vector, instead we use multiple vectors which focus on different parts of the question for its overall semantic representation and apply multiple steps of attention to learn representations for the candidate answers.
method	For each attention step, in addition to common attention mechanisms, we adopt sequential attention which utilizes context information for computing context-aware attention weights.
method	Via extensive experiments, we show that MAN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on popular benchmark QA datasets.
result	Empirical studies confirm the effectiveness of sequential attention over other attention mechanisms.

background	Group data sharing in cloud environments has become a hot topic in recent decades.
background	With the popularity of cloud computing, how to achieve secure and efficient data sharing in cloud environments is an urgent problem to be solved.
background	In addition, how to achieve both anonymity and traceability is also a challenge in the cloud for data sharing.
objective	This paper focuses on enabling data sharing and storage for the same group in the cloud with high security and efficiency in an anonymous manner.
method	By leveraging the key agreement and the group signature, a novel traceable group data sharing scheme is proposed to support anonymous multiple users in public clouds.
method	On the one hand, group members can communicate anonymously with respect to the group signature, and the real identities of members can be traced if necessary.
method	On the other hand, a common conference key is derived based on the key agreement to enable group members to share and store their data securely.
method	Note that a symmetric balanced incomplete block design is utilized for key generation, which substantially reduces the burden on members to derive a common conference key.
result	Both theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient for group data sharing in cloud computing.

background	We consider supervised learning in the presence of very many irrelevant features, and study two different regularization methods for preventing overfitting.
background	Focusing on logistic regression, we show that using L1 regularization of the parameters, the sample complexity (i.e., the number of training examples required to learn "well,") grows only logarithmically in the number of irrelevant features.
method	This logarithmic rate matches the best known bounds for feature selection, and indicates that L1 regularized logistic regression can be effective even if there are exponentially many irrelevant features as there are training examples.
method	We also give a lower-bound showing that any rotationally invariant algorithm---including logistic regression with L2 regularization, SVMs, and neural networks trained by backpropagation---has a worst case sample complexity that grows at least linearly in the number of irrelevant features.

background	Clustering, in data mining, is useful to discover distribution patterns in the underlying data.
background	Clustering algorithms usually employ a distance metric based (e.g., euclidean) similarity measure in order to partition the database such that data points in the same partition are more similar than points in different partitions.
objective	In this paper, we study clustering algorithms for data with boolean and categorical attributes.
method	We show that traditional clustering algorithms that use distances between points for clustering are not appropriate for boolean and categorical attributes.
method	Instead, we propose a novel concept of links to measure the similarity/proximity between a pair of data points.
method	We develop a robust hierarchical clustering algorithm ROCK that employs links and not distances when merging clusters.
method	Our methods naturally extend to non-metric similarity measures that are relevant in situations where a domain expert/similarity table is the only source of knowledge.
result	In addition to presenting detailed complexity results for ROCK, we also conduct an experimental study with real-life as well as synthetic data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques.
result	For data with categorical attributes, our findings indicate that ROCK not only generates better quality clusters than traditional algorithms, but it also exhibits good scalability properties.

background	Instant messaging (IM) has become one of the most popular forms of computer-mediated communication (CMC) and is especially prevalent on college campuses.
background	Previous research suggests that IM users often multitask while conversing online.
background	To date, no one has yet examined the cognitive effect of concurrent IM use.
background	Participants in the present study (N = 69) completed a reading comprehension task uninterrupted or while concurrently holding an IM conversation.
method	Participants who IMed while performing the reading task took significantly longer to complete the task, indicating that concurrent IM use negatively affects efficiency.
method	Concurrent IM use did not affect reading comprehension scores.
result	Additional analyses revealed that the more time participants reported spending on IM, the lower their reading comprehension scores.
result	Finally, we found that the more time participants reported spending on IM, the lower their self-reported GPA.
other	Implications and future directions are discussed.

background	Waterfall development is still a widely used way of working in software development companies.
background	Many problems have been reported related to the model.
background	Commonly accepted problems are for example to cope with change and that defects all too often are detected too late in the software development process.
background	However, many of the problems mentioned in literature are based on beliefs and experiences, and not on empirical evidence.
method	To address this research gap, we compare the problems in literature with the results of a case study at Ericsson AB in Sweden, investigating issues in the waterfall model.
result	The case study aims at validating or contradicting the beliefs of what the problems are in waterfall development through empirical research.

background	The seemingly unshakeable accuracy of Moore's law - which states that the speed of computers; as measured by the number of transistors that can be placed on a single chip, will double every year or two - has been credited with being the engine of the electronics revolution, and is regarded as the premier example of a self-fulfilling prophecy and technological trajectory in both the academic and popular press.
background	Although many factors have kept Moore's law as an industry benchmark, it is the entry of foreign competition that seems to have played a critical role in maintaining the pace of Moore's law in the early VLSI transition.
background	Many different kinds of chips used many competing logic families.
background	DRAMs and microprocessors became critical to the semiconductor industry, yet were unknown during the original formulation of Moore's law

objective	This paper measures flow in the context of gamification and investigates the psychometric properties of the Dispositional Flow Scale-2 (DFS-2).
result	We employ data gathered from users of an exercise gamification service (N = 200).
result	The results show that the original DFS-2 factorial structure does result in a similar model fit as the original work.
result	However, we also present a factorial respecification that satisfies more recent model fit thresholds.
result	Beyond validating the original DFS-2 instrument in the context of gamification, the psychometric analysis and the respecifications suggest that the components of flow divide into highly correlated conditions of flow (which were also found to be more salient in the context of gamification: autotelic experience, balance of skill and challenge, control, clear goals, and feedback) and into possible outcomes (merging action-awareness, concentration, loss of sense of time, and loss of selfconsciousness) from achieving flow.

background	Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector.
background	When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words.
background	Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words.
background	For example, “powerful,” “strong” and “Paris” are equally distant.
objective	In this paper, we proposeParagraph Vector , an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents.
method	Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document.
method	Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-ofwords models.
result	Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations.
result	Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.

background	Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have the tendency to converge quickly into a single solution in the search space.
background	However, many complex search problems require the identification and maintenance of multiple solutions.
method	Niching methods are the extension of EAs to address this issue.
method	In our study, we propose an evolution strategy (ES) niching method, based on the covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) mechanism.
method	We analyze our algorithm, introduce an experimental setup, and compare its performance with a previous ES niching method, known as the ES dynamic niching algorithm.
result	In our comparison we introduce for the first time a new analytical tool for niching analysis, and in particular the early niching formation process.
result	Based on successful data fit, we propose the well-known logistic model to describe our experimental results.

background	0: Typically, COTS undergo frequent upgrades.
background	1: Organizations while deploying these upgrades ensure the correctness of existing systems by carrying out exhaustive regression tests.
background	2: This process is typically costly and time-consuming.
background	3: An efficient approach to regression testing would be to execute a subset of the system test suite that provides sufficient confidence in the system behavior.

objective	0: This article deals with a ring–mesh network design problem arising from the deployment of an optical transport network.
objective	1: The problem seeks to partition the set of demand pairs to a number of rings and a mesh cluster, and to determine the location of the optical cross-connect system (OXC), while minimizing the total cost of optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs), OXCs, and fiber links.
method	2: We formulate this problem as a zero-one integer programming problem.
method	3: In strengthening the formulation, we develop some valid inequalities for the zero-one quadratic (knapsack) polytope and a columngeneration formulation that eliminates the symmetry of ring configurations.
method	4: Also, we prescribe an effective tabu search procedure for finding a goodquality feasible solution, which is also used as a starting column for the column generation procedure.

background	The video game software industry has a reputation for volatile, chaotic projects yet, in spite of dramatic growth in global revenues, surprisingly little academic work has examined these projects.
objective	This study reports a preliminary investigation into this under-researched area.
method	We interviewed eight video game producers from a range of companies, using a critical incident method to explore risk management practices and risk perceptions.
result	Our results revealed that in lieu of formal risk management practices, these managers relied on prototyping, pre-production decision points, and agile approaches to contain risk on their projects.
result	Among the risk factors mentioned, two are specific to the unique context of video game development.
result	The risk of failing to match the development strategy to the project was identified as a major cause of problems during the development process, and a new risk - the 'fun factor' - was a key element threatening the success of the final game release.

background	Phase noise is a topic of theoretical and practical interest in electronic circuits, as well as in other fields such as optics.
background	Although progress has been made in understanding the phenomenon, there still remain significant gaps, both in its fundamental theory and in numerical techniques for its characterisation.
objective	In this paper, we develop a solid foundation for phase noise that is valid for any oscillator, regardless of operating mechanism.
objective	We establish novel results about the dynamics of stable nonlinear oscillators in the presence of perturbations, both deterministic and random.
method	We obtain an exact, nonlinear equation for phase error, which we solve without approximations for random perturbations.
method	This leads us to a precise characterisation of timing jitter and spectral dispersion, for computing which we develop efficient numerical methods.
result	We demonstrate our techniques on practical electrical oscillators, and obtain good matches with measurements even at frequencies close to the carrier, where previous techniques break down.

background	Many Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms are item-based in the sense that they analyze item-item relations in order to produce item similarities.
background	Recently, several works in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggested to learn a latent representation of words using neural embedding algorithms.
background	Among them, the Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS), also known as word2vec, was shown to provide state-of-the-art results on various linguistics tasks.
objective	In this paper, we show that item-based CF can be cast in the same framework of neural word embedding.
method	Inspired by SGNS, we describe a method we name item2vec for item-based CF that produces embedding for items in a latent space.
method	The method is capable of inferring item-item relations even when user information is not available.
result	We present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the item2vec method and show it is competitive with SVD.

background	Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC Challenge datasets, plateaued in the final years of the competition.
background	The best-performing methods were complex ensemble systems that typically combined multiple low-level image features with high-level context.
objective	In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 50 percent relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012-achieving a mAP of 62.4 percent.
method	Our approach combines two ideas: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data are scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, boosts performance significantly.
result	Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call the resulting model an R-CNN or Region-based Convolutional Network.

background	Having developed multiobjective optimization algorithms using evolutionary optimization methods and demonstrated their niche on various practical problems involving mostly two and three objectives, there is now a growing need for developing evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms for handling many-objective (having four or more objectives) optimization problems.
objective	In this paper, we recognize a few recent efforts and discuss a number of viable directions for developing a potential EMO algorithm for solving many-objective optimization problems.
method	Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following NSGA-II framework (we call it NSGA-III) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points.
method	The proposed NSGA-III is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested EMO algorithm (MOEA/D).
method	While each of the two MOEA/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed NSGA-III is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper.
result	This paper presents results on unconstrained problems, and the sequel paper considers constrained and other specialties in handling many-objective optimization problems.

background	The main contribution of this paper is an approach for introducing additional context into state-of-the-art general object detection.
method	To achieve this we first combine a state-ofthe-art classifier (Residual-101 [14]) with a fast detection framework (SSD [18]).
method	We then augment SSD+Residual101 with deconvolution layers to introduce additional largescale context in object detection and improve accuracy, especially for small objects, calling our resulting system DSSD for deconvolutional single shot detector.
background	While these two contributions are easily described at a high-level, a naive implementation does not succeed.
method	Instead we show that carefully adding additional stages of learned transformations, specifically a module for feed-forward connections in deconvolution and a new output module, enables this new approach and forms a potential way forward for further detection research.
result	Results are shown on both PASCAL VOC and COCO detection.
result	Our DSSD with 513 × 513 input achieves 81.5% mAP on VOC2007 test, 80.0% mAP on VOC2012 test, and 33.2% mAP on COCO, outperforming a state-of-the-art method R-FCN [3] on each dataset.

background	Many companies are deploying services, either for consumers or industry, which are largely based on machine-learning algorithms for sophisticated processing of large amounts of data.
background	The state-of-the-art and most popular such machine-learning algorithms are Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks (CNNs and DNNs), which are known to be both computationally and memory intensive.
background	A number of neural network accelerators have been recently proposed which can offer high computational capacity/area ratio, but which remain hampered by memory accesses.
background	However, unlike the memory wall faced by processors on general-purpose workloads, the CNNs and DNNs memory footprint, while large, is not beyond the capability of the on-chip storage of a multi-chip system.
background	This property, combined with the CNN/DNN algorithmic characteristics, can lead to high internal bandwidth and low external communications, which can in turn enable high-degree parallelism at a reasonable area cost.
objective	In this article, we introduce a custom multi-chip machine-learning architecture along those lines.
method	We show that, on a subset of the largest known neural network layers, it is possible to achieve a speedup of 450.65x over a GPU, and reduce the energy by 150.31x on average for a 64-chip system.
method	We implement the node down to the place and route at 28nm, containing a combination of custom storage and computational units, with industry-grade interconnects.

background	Large-pose face alignment is a very challenging problem in computer vision, which is used as a prerequisite for many important vision tasks, e.g, face recognition and 3D face reconstruction.
background	Recently, there have been a few attempts to solve this problem, but still more research is needed to achieve highly accurate results.
method	In this paper, we propose a face alignment method for large-pose face images, by combining the powerful cascaded CNN regressor method and 3DMM.
method	We formulate the face alignment as a 3DMM fitting problem, where the camera projection matrix and 3D shape parameters are estimated by a cascade of CNN-based regressors.
method	The dense 3D shape allows us to design pose-invariant appearance features for effective CNN learning.
result	Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging databases (AFLW and AFW), with comparison to the state of the art.

background	What will 5G be?
background	What it will not be is an incremental advance on 4G.
background	The previous four generations of cellular technology have each been a major paradigm shift that has broken backward compatibility.
background	Indeed, 5G will need to be a paradigm shift that includes very high carrier frequencies with massive bandwidths, extreme base station and device densities, and unprecedented numbers of antennas.
background	However, unlike the previous four generations, it will also be highly integrative: tying any new 5G air interface and spectrum together with LTE and WiFi to provide universal high-rate coverage and a seamless user experience.
background	To support this, the core network will also have to reach unprecedented levels of flexibility and intelligence, spectrum regulation will need to be rethought and improved, and energy and cost efficiencies will become even more critical considerations.
method	This paper discusses all of these topics, identifying key challenges for future research and preliminary 5G standardization activities, while providing a comprehensive overview of the current literature, and in particular of the papers appearing in this special issue.

background	Engineers and researchers in the automobile industry have tried to design and build safer automobiles, but traffic accidents are unavoidable.
background	Patterns involved in dangerous crashes could be detected if we develop accurate prediction models capable of automatic classification of type of injury severity of various traffic accidents.
background	These behavioral and roadway accident patterns can be useful to develop traffic safety control policies.
background	We believe that to obtain the greatest possible accident reduction effects with limited budgetary resources, it is important that measures be based on scientific and objective surveys of the causes of accidents and severity of injuries.
method	This paper summarizes the performance of four machine learning paradigms applied to modeling the severity of injury that occurred during traffic accidents.
method	We considered neural networks trained using hybrid learning approaches, support vector machines, decision trees and a concurrent hybrid model involving decision trees and neural networks.
result	Experiment results reveal that among the machine learning paradigms considered the hybrid decision tree-neural network approach outperformed the individual approaches.

objective	This paper introduces GEOS, the first automated system to solve unaltered SAT geometry questions by combining text understanding and diagram interpretation.
objective	We model the problem of understanding geometry questions as submodular optimization, and identify a formal problem description likely to be compatible with both the question text and diagram.
method	GEOS then feeds the description to a geometric solver that attempts to determine the correct answer.
result	In our experiments, GEOS achieves a 49% score on official SAT questions, and a score of 61% on practice questions.1 Finally, we show that by integrating textual and visual information, GEOS boosts the accuracy of dependency and semantic parsing of the question text.

background	The role of frameworks in information systems has recently received a great deal of critical attention.
background	One prominent indictment, which has been directed at even commonly accepted frameworks, is that they lack empirical support, and in fact are not constructed in operational terminology.
method	This article reports the results of an experimental ab study using MBA students as subjects to investigate the tenets of the Gorry and Scott Morton framework (Gorry and Scott Morton, 1971).
result	While firm support is found for the assumption that the level of information attributes varies across system type in the direction postulated, there is evidence that the ability to differentiate the component attributes is affected by such factors as field dependency and mode of presentation.

background	With the transition of facial expression recognition (FER) from laboratory-controlled to challenging in-the-wild conditions and the recent success of deep learning techniques in various fields, deep neural networks have increasingly been leveraged to learn discriminative representations for automatic FER.
background	Recent deep FER systems generally focus on two important issues: overfitting caused by a lack of sufficient training data and expression-unrelated variations, such as illumination, head pose and identity bias.
objective	In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on deep FER, including datasets and algorithms that provide insights into these intrinsic problems.
method	First, we introduce the available datasets that are widely used in the literature and provide accepted data selection and evaluation principles for these datasets.
method	We then describe the standard pipeline of a deep FER system with the related background knowledge and suggestions of applicable implementations for each stage.
method	For the state of the art in deep FER, we review existing novel deep neural networks and related training strategies that are designed for FER based on both static images and dynamic image sequences, and discuss their advantages and limitations.
method	Competitive performances on widely used benchmarks are also summarized in this section.
method	We then extend our survey to additional related issues and application scenarios.
result	Finally, we review the remaining challenges and corresponding opportunities in this field as well as future directions for the design of robust deep FER systems.

background	Advertisers are demanding more accurate estimates of the impact of targeted advertisements, yet no study proposes an appropriate methodology to analyze the effectiveness of a targeted advertising campaign, and there is a dearth of empirical evidence on the effectiveness of targeted advertising as a whole.
background	The targeted population is more likely to convert from advertising so the response lift between the targeted and untargeted group to the advertising is likely an overestimate of the impact of targeted advertising.
method	We propose a difference-in-differences estimator to account for this selection bias by decomposing the impact of targeting into selection bias and treatment effects components.
method	Using several large-scale online advertising campaigns, we test the effectiveness of targeted advertising on brand-related searches and clickthrough rates.
result	We find that the treatment effect on the targeted group is about twice as large for brand-related searches, but naively estimating this effect without taking into account selection bias leads to an overestimation of the lift from targeting on brand-related searches by almost 1,000%.

background	While significant attention has been recently focused on designing supervised deep semantic segmentation algorithms for vision tasks, there are many domains in which sufficient supervised pixel-level labels are difficult to obtain.
objective	In this paper, we revisit the problem of purely unsupervised image segmentation and propose a novel deep architecture for this problem.
method	We borrow recent ideas from supervised semantic segmentation methods, in particular by concatenating two fully convolutional networks together into an autoencoder—one for encoding and one for decoding.
method	The encoding layer produces a k-way pixelwise prediction, and both the reconstruction error of the autoencoder as well as the normalized cut produced by the encoder are jointly minimized during training.
result	When combined with suitable postprocessing involving conditional random field smoothing and hierarchical segmentation, our resulting algorithm achieves impressive results on the benchmark Berkeley Segmentation Data Set, outperforming a number of competing methods.

background	Host-based security tools such as anti-virus and intrusion detection systems are not adequately protected on today's computers.
background	Malware is often designed to immediately disable any security tools upon installation, rendering them useless.
objective	While current research has focused on moving these vulnerable security tools into an isolated virtual machine, this approach cripples security tools by preventing them from doing active monitoring.
method	This paper describes an architecture that takes a hybrid approach, giving security tools the ability to do active monitoring while still benefiting from the increased security of an isolated virtual machine.
method	We discuss the architecture and a prototype implementation that can process hooks from a virtual machine running Windows XP on Xen.
result	We conclude with a security analysis and show the performance of a single hook to be 28 musecs in the best case.

background	Recently, Convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures in deep learning have achieved significant results in the field of computer vision.
objective	To transform this performance toward the task of intrusion detection (ID) in cyber security, this paper models network traffic as time-series, particularly transmission control protocol / internet protocol (TCP/IP) packets in a predefined time range with supervised learning methods such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), CNN, CNN-recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN), CNN-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) and CNN-gated recurrent unit (GRU), using millions of known good and bad network connections.
method	To measure the efficacy of these approaches we evaluate on the most important synthetic ID data set such as KDDCup 99.
method	To select the optimal network architecture, comprehensive analysis of various MLP, CNN, CNN-RNN, CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU with its topologies, network parameters and network structures is used.
method	The models in each experiment are run up to 1000 epochs with learning rate in the range [0.01-05].
result	CNN and its variant architectures have significantly performed well in comparison to the classical machine learning classifiers.
result	This is mainly due to the reason that CNN have capability to extract high level feature representations that represents the abstract form of low level feature sets of network traffic connections.

background	The human forearm is composed of two long, thin bones called the radius and the ulna, and rotates using two axle joints.
objective	We aimed to develop a forearm based on the body proportion, weight ratio, muscle arrangement, and joint performance of the human body in order to bring out its benefits.
method	For this, we need to miniaturize the muscle modules.
method	To approach this task, we arranged two muscle motors inside one muscle module, and used the space effectively by utilizing common parts.
method	In addition, we enabled the muscle module to also be used as the bone structure.
method	Moreover, we used miniature motors and developed a way to dissipate the motor heat to the bone structure.
result	Through these approaches, we succeeded in developing a forearm with a radioulnar joint based on the body proportion, weight ratio, muscle arrangement, and joint performance of the human body, while keeping maintainability and reliability.
result	Also, we performed some motions such as soldering, opening a book, turning a screw, and badminton swinging using the benefits of the radioulnar structure, which have not been discussed before, and verified that Kengoro can realize skillful motions using the radioulnar joint like a human.

objective	1 This paper describes a decentralized peer-to-peer model for building a Web crawler.
background	Most of the current systems use a centralized client-server model, in which the crawl is done by one or more tightly coupled machines, but the distribution of the crawling jobs and the collection of crawled results are managed in a centralized system using a centralized URL repository.
background	Centralized solutions are known to have problems like link congestion, being a single point of failure, and expensive administration.

background	Data clustering is a frequently used technique in finance, computer science, and engineering.
background	In most of the applications, cluster sizes are either constrained to particular values or available as prior knowledge.
background	Unfortunately, traditional clustering methods cannot impose constrains on cluster sizes.
method	In this paper, we propose some vital modifications to the standard k-means algorithm such that it can incorporate size constraints for each cluster separately.
method	The modified k-means algorithm can be used to obtain clusters in preferred sizes.
method	A potential application would be obtaining clusters with equal cluster size.
method	Moreover, the modified algorithm makes use of prior knowledge of the given data set for selectively initializing the cluster centroids which helps escaping from local minima.
result	Simulation results on multidimensional data demonstrate that the k-means algorithm with the proposed modifications can fulfill cluster size constraints and lead to more accurate and robust results.

background	We are still at an early stage and thus require a deeper understanding of how the blockchain potentials can be realized, and what are the opportunities and challenges in so doing.
objective	Following a design science approach, we developed a proof of concept prototype that has the potential to replace a trust-based coffee shop payment solution that is based on an analogue, pre-paid punch card solution.
method	The demonstrator provides a starting point to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the blockchain technology when replacing a trust-based by a trust-free transaction system.
result	We conclude that the secure and trust-free blockchain-based transaction has the potential to change many existing trust-based transaction systems, but that scalability issues, costs, and volatility in the transaction currency are hindrances.

background	Little is known about the effects of successful psychotherapy on brain function in subjects with anxiety disorders.
objective	The present study aimed to identify changes in brain activation following cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in subjects suffering from specific phobia.
method	Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain activation to spider videos was measured in 28 spider phobic and 14 healthy control subjects.
method	Phobics were randomly assigned to a therapy-group (TG) and a waiting-list control group (WG).
method	Both groups of phobics were scanned twice.
method	Between scanning sessions, CBT was given to the TG.
method	Before therapy, brain activation did not differ between both groups of phobics.
method	As compared to control subjects, phobics showed greater responses to spider vs. control videos in the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).

background	Backpropagation and contrastive Hebbian learning are two methods of training networks with hidden neurons.
background	Backpropagation computes an error signal for the output neurons and spreads it over the hidden neurons.
background	Contrastive Hebbian learning involves clamping the output neurons at desired values and letting the effect spread through feedback connections over the entire network.
method	To investigate the relationship between these two forms of learning, we consider a special case in which they are identical: a multilayer perceptron with linear output units, to which weak feedback connections have been added.
result	In this case, the change in network state caused by clamping the output neurons turns out to be the same as the error signal spread by backpropagation, except for a scalar prefactor.
result	This suggests that the functionality of backpropagation can be realized alternatively by a Hebbian-type learning algorithm, which is suitable for implementation in biological networks.

background	Fake news on social media can have significant negative societal effects.
background	Identifying and mitigating fake news also presents unique challenges.
background	To tackle these challenges, many existing research efforts exploit various features of the data, including network features.

background	Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been used in Information Retrieval.
background	The results are not encouraging.
background	Simple methods (stopwording, porter-style stemming, etc.) usually yield significant improvements, while higher-level processing (chunking, parsing, word sense disambiguation, etc.)
method	only yield very small improvements or even a decrease in accuracy.
method	At the same time, higher-level methods increase the processing and storage cost dramatically.

background	For various reasons, the cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet certain requirements (e.g. low latency and jitter, context awareness, mobility support) that are crucial for several applications (e.g. vehicular networks, augmented reality).
background	To fulfil these requirements, various paradigms, such as fog computing, mobile edge computing, and mobile cloud computing, have emerged in recent years.
background	While these edge paradigms share several features, most of the existing research is compartmentalised; no synergies have been explored.
background	This is especially true in the field of security, where most analyses focus only on one edge paradigm, while ignoring the others.
objective	The main goal of this study is to holistically analyse the security threats, challenges, and mechanisms inherent in all edge paradigms, while highlighting potential synergies and venues of collaboration.
objective	In our results, we will show that all edge paradigms should consider the advances in other paradigms.

background	In any competitive business, success is based on the ability to make an item more appealing to customers than the competition.
background	A number of questions arise in the context of this task: how do we formalize and quantify the competitiveness between two items?
background	Who are the main competitors of a given item?
background	What are the features of an item that most affect its competitiveness?
background	Despite the impact and relevance of this problem to many domains, only a limited amount of work has been devoted toward an effective solution.

method	Our evaluation of competitiveness utilizes customer reviews, an abundant source of information that is available in a wide range of domains.
method	We present efficient methods for evaluating competitiveness in large review datasets and address the natural problem of finding the top-k competitors of a given item.
result	Finally, we evaluate the quality of our results and the scalability of our approach using multiple datasets from different domains.

background	Attentional, RNN-based encoder-decoder models for abstractive summarization have achieved good performance on short input and output sequences.
background	For longer documents and summaries however these models often include repetitive and incoherent phrases.
method	We introduce a neural network model with a novel intraattention that attends over the input and continuously generated output separately, and a new training method that combines standard supervised word prediction and reinforcement learning (RL).
method	Models trained only with supervised learning often exhibit “exposure bias” – they assume ground truth is provided at each step during training.
method	However, when standard word prediction is combined with the global sequence prediction training of RL the resulting summaries become more readable.
result	We evaluate this model on the CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times datasets.
result	Our model obtains a 41.16 ROUGE-1 score on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, an improvement over previous state-of-the-art models.
result	Human evaluation also shows that our model produces higher quality summaries.

background	When training data are obtained from the Internet, the labels are likely to be ambiguous and inaccurate.
objective	This paper presents a Light CNN framework to learn a compact embedding on the large-scale face data with massive noisy labels.
method	First, we introduce a variation of maxout activation, called max-feature-map (MFM), into each convolutional layer of CNN.
method	Different from maxout activation that uses many feature maps to linearly approximate an arbitrary convex activation function, MFM does so via a competitive relationship.
method	MFM can not only separate noisy and informative signals but also play the role of feature selection between two feature maps.
method	Second, three networks are carefully designed to obtain better performance, meanwhile, reducing the number of parameters and computational costs.
method	Finally, a semantic bootstrapping method is proposed to make the prediction of the networks more consistent with noisy labels.
result	Experimental results show that the proposed framework can utilize large-scale noisy data to learn a Light model that is efficient in computational costs and storage spaces.
result	The learned single network with a 256-D representation achieves state-of-the-art results on various face benchmarks without fine-tuning.

background	Machine learning techniques based on neural networks are achieving remarkable results in a wide variety of domains.
background	Often, the training of models requires large, representative datasets, which may be crowdsourced and contain sensitive information.
background	The models should not expose private information in these datasets.
method	Addressing this goal, we develop new algorithmic techniques for learning and a refined analysis of privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy.
result	Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that we can train deep neural networks with non-convex objectives, under a modest privacy budget, and at a manageable cost in software complexity, training efficiency, and model quality.

background	Previous studies have presented conflicting claims regarding reasons that people become addicted to the Internet.
objective	In this study, we attempted to identify predictors of Internet addiction based on Sullivan's interpersonal theory and Internet addiction literature.
method	In our research model, it is hypothesized that good parent-child relationship positively correlates with good interpersonal relationships, which in turn are hypothesized to correlate with undesirable social anxiety.
method	In addition, both parent-child and interpersonal relationships are hypothesized to negatively correlate with Internet addiction, whereas the level of social anxiety is hypothesized to positively correlate with Internet addiction.
result	The results of this study confirm the research model hypotheses, indicating that the quality of parent-child relationship is indeed positively correlated to the quality of our participants' interpersonal relationships and that frustrating interpersonal relationships may raise the level of social anxiety.
result	In addition, interpersonal relationships, the parent-child relationship, and social anxiety all influence Internet addiction, as predicted by the model.
result	Finally, the more social anxiety and discontent with their peer interactions the participants experienced, the more addicted they were to the Internet.

background	For urban driving, knowledge of ego-vehicle's position is a critical piece of information that enables advanced driver-assistance systems or self-driving cars to execute safety-related, autonomous driving maneuvers.
background	This is because, without knowing the current location, it is very hard to autonomously execute any driving maneuvers for the future.
background	The existing solutions for localization rely on a combination of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), an inertial measurement unit, and a digital map.
background	However, on urban driving environments, due to poor satellite geometry and disruption of radio signal reception, their longitudinal and lateral errors are too significant to be used to guide an autonomous system.
objective	To enhance the existing system's localization capability, this work presents an effort of developing a vision-based lateral localization algorithm.
method	The algorithm aims at reliably counting, with or without observations of lane-markings, the number road-lanes and identifying the index of the road-lane on the roadway that our vehicle happens to be driving on.
result	Testings the proposed algorithms against inter-city and inter-state highway videos showed promising results in terms of counting the number of road-lanes and the indices of the current road-lanes.

background	The core capabilities of an organization include critical skills of employees, management systems, and norms and values.
background	Core capabilities may be transferred fonnally and explicitly.
background	However, much knowledge, particularly knowledge with rich tacit dimensions, is transferred informally through processes of socialization and intemaiization.
objective	We focus on two transfer mechanisms—mentoring and storytelling—that can leverage the knowledge of an organization, particularly its tacit knowledge, to build core capabilities.
method	We draw on relevant research in leaming and cognitive psychology to clarify the conditions under which mentoring and storytelling can be most effective as carriers of knowledge.
method	Finally, we present recommendations for specific managerial practices that follow from our analysis.

background	There has been much interest in the Sharing Economy in recent years, accompanied with the hope that it will change and specifically make better use of existing resources.
background	It intuitively makes sense, from a sustainability point of view, that the sharing of resources is good.
background	It could even be said that the Sharing Economy ought to align well with Computing within Limits and its underlying premises.
method	In this paper however, we take a critical stance and will elaborate on the intersection between the Sharing Economy and Limits (including pinpointing potential conflicts) so as to identify and discuss a 'Limits-compliant Sharing Economy'.
method	We argue that even though there are limits to the Sharing Economy today, it still has potential benefits for a future of scarcity---but only if the practice of sharing is approached with a dual focus on sharing and on limits at the same time.
result	Finally we conclude that even though we have begun to explore the future of sharing, there is still a need to further develop ideas of how the underlying infrastructure for this movement will look.

background	There are many situations in which it is desirable to be able to distinguish spontaneous speech and speech which is non-spontaneous.
background	Examples of situations in which this problem may arise include forensic evidence situations, sorting voice-mail responses from voice-mail menus, and automatic segmentation of spontaneous responses from prepared questions.
background	The later situation can occur if it is desired to create a database of spontaneous data from data which consists of spontaneous discourse responding to prepared prompts.
method	This paper outlines and compares three methods for automatically classifying spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech and presents the cxperimcntal results comparing the performance of the methods.
method	All three methods are based on an analysis of the probability distributions of prosodic fcatures extracted from the speech signal.
method	The first method uses an expansion of the of the probability distribution in terms of the statistical moments.
method	The second method is an application of a modifed Hellinger’s method applied to histograms of signal amplitude and other speech features.
method	The third method is based on a measure of the nonGaussianity of the data.

background	Survival analysis (time-to-event analysis) is widely used in economics and finance, engineering, medicine and many other areas.
background	A fundamental problem is to understand the relationship between the covariates and the (distribution of) survival times (times-to-event).
background	Much of the previous work has approached the problem by viewing the survival time as the first hitting time of a stochastic process, assuming a specific form for the underlying stochastic process, using available data to learn the relationship between the covariates and the parameters of the model, and then deducing the relationship between covariates and the distribution of first hitting times (the risk).
background	However, previous models rely on strong parametric assumptions that are often violated.
objective	This paper proposes a very different approach to survival analysis, DeepHit, that uses a deep neural network to learn the distribution of survival times directly.
method	DeepHit makes no assumptions about the underlying stochastic process and allows for the possibility that the relationship between covariates and risk(s) changes over time.
method	Most importantly, DeepHit smoothly handles competing risks; i.e. settings in which there is more than one possible event of interest.
result	Comparisons with previous models on the basis of real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DeepHit achieves large and statistically significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.

background	V-model and its variants have become the most common process models adopted in automotive industry guiding the development of systems on a variety of refinement levels.
background	Along with the exponentially growing complexity of modern vehicle systems, however, the late verification and validation in the conventional V-model expand in uncontrollable ways that result in higher cost of development and higher risk of failure than ever.
objective	This paper describes an inc-V development process for automotive industry that improves the conventional V-model and variants by introducing and institutionalizing early and continuous integrated verification enabled by simulation-based development.
method	We developed a continuous simulation model of the inc-V process, and the initial version is used to investigate the characteristics of the inc-V compared to V. The preliminary finding from the simulations of an example project is that the inc-V process is able to improve the traditional V process by saving effort, shortening duration, and increasing product quality.
result	The finding also show how the advance of development technology impacts the systems engineering processes.

background	Automated medical image analysis has a significant value in diagnosis and treatment of lesions.
background	Brain tumors segmentation has a special importance and difficulty due to the difference in appearances and shapes of the different tumor regions in magnetic resonance images.
background	Additionally the data sets are heterogeneous and usually limited in size in comparison with the computer vision problems.
background	The recently proposed adversarial training has shown promising results in generative image modeling.
objective	In this paper we propose a novel end-to-end trainable architecture for brain tumor semantic segmentation through conditional adversarial training.
method	We exploit conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and train a semantic segmentation Convolution Neural Network (CNN) along with an adversarial network that discriminates segmentation maps coming from the ground truth or from the segmentation network for BraTS 2017 segmentation task[15,4,2,3].
method	We also propose an end-to-end trainable CNN for survival day prediction based on deep learning techniques for BraTS 2017 prediction task [15,4,2,3].
result	The experimental results demonstrate the superior ability of the proposed approach for both tasks.
result	The proposed model achieves on validation data a DICE score, Sensitivity and Specificity respectively 0.68, 0.99 and 0.98 for the whole tumor, regarding online judgment system.

background	T paper shows that corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm value are positively related for firms with high customer awareness, as proxied by advertising expenditures.
background	For firms with low customer awareness, the relation is either negative or insignificant.
background	In addition, we find that the effect of awareness on the CSR–value relation is reversed for firms with a poor prior reputation as corporate citizens.
background	This evidence is consistent with the view that CSR activities can add value to the firm but only under certain conditions.

background	Monitoring the attentive and emotional status of the driver is critical for the safety and comfort of driving.
objective	In this work a real-time non-intrusive monitoring system is developed, which detects the emotional states of the driver by analyzing facial expressions.
method	The system considers two negative basic emotions, anger and disgust, as stress related emotions.
method	We detect an individual emotion in each video frame and the decision on the stress level is made on sequence level.
result	Experimental results show that the developed system operates very well on simulated data even with generic models.
result	An additional pose normalization step reduces the impact of pose mismatch due to camera setup and pose variation, and hence improves the detection accuracy further.

background	Item recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized ranking on a set of items (e.g. websites, movies, products).
objective	In this paper, we investigate the most common scenario with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks, purchases).
method	There are many methods for item recommendation from implicit feedback like matrix factorization (MF) or adaptive knearest-neighbor (kNN).
method	Even though these methods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, none of them is directly optimized for ranking.
objective	In this paper we present a generic optimization criterion BPR-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximum posterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem.
method	We also provide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect to BPR-Opt.
method	The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling.
method	We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-art recommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive kNN.
result	Our experiments indicate that for the task of personalized ranking our optimization method outperforms the standard learning techniques for MF and kNN.
result	The results show the importance of optimizing models for the right criterion.

background	Traditional syntax models typically leverage part-of-speech (POS) information by constructing features from hand-tuned templates.
objective	We demonstrate that a better approach is to utilize POS tags as a regularizer of learned representations.
method	We propose a simple method for learning a stacked pipeline of models which we call “stack-propagation”.
method	We apply this to dependency parsing and tagging, where we use the hidden layer of the tagger network as a representation of the input tokens for the parser.
method	At test time, our parser does not require predicted POS tags.

background	Automatically generating a natural language description of an image has attracted interests recently both because of its importance in practical applications and because it connects two major artificial intelligence fields: computer vision and natural language processing.
background	Existing approaches are either top-down, which start from a gist of an image and convert it into words, or bottom-up, which come up with words describing various aspects of an image and then combine them.
objective	In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that combines both approaches through a model of semantic attention.
method	Our algorithm learns to selectively attend to semantic concept proposals and fuse them into hidden states and outputs of recurrent neural networks.
method	The selection and fusion form a feedback connecting the top-down and bottom-up computation.
result	We evaluate our algorithm on two public benchmarks: Microsoft COCO and Flickr30K.
result	Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches consistently across different evaluation metrics.

background	Wireless personal area network (WPAN) is small-ranged network centered at an individual for interconnecting personal devices.
background	For such a network, the bootstrapping mechanism with which the devices establish a secure group key is of critical importance.
background	Most existing bootstrapping mechanisms require out-of-band channels and involve human interactions for authentication.
objective	In this paper, we aim to develop a fully automated bootstrapping mechanism with only in-band channels with approvable security.
method	Toward this end, we designed an integrity-guaranteed message (IGM) structure, a self-authenticated key agreement protocol, and a prescheduling mechanism in allusion to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for WPANs.
method	The IGM structure guarantees that an adversary cannot modify the IGM message without being detected, thus protects the message integrity without the requirement of shared secrets between the sender and the receiver devices.
method	The proposed self-authenticated key agreement protocol utilizes the IGM's integrity guaranteed property, works together with the prescheduling mechanism to achieve message self-authentication, thus protecting the secure bootstrapping process from the node impersonation attack and the man-in-the-middle attack without leveraging any out-of-band channels.
result	We analyze the security performance of the proposed schemes, and show that they can be seamless interoperative with the existing IEEE 802.15.4 standard.

background	Traditionally, the normalized cross correlation (NCC) based or shape based template matching methods are utilized in machine vision to locate an object for a robot pick and place or other automatic equipment.
background	For stability, well-designed LED lighting must be mounted to uniform and stabilize lighting condition.
background	Even so, these algorithms are not robust to detect the small, blurred, or large deformed target in industrial environment.
objective	In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based object localization method, called C-CNN: cascaded convolutional neural network, to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional methods.
method	Our C-CNN method first applies a shallow CNN densely scanning the whole image, most of the background regions are rejected by the network.
method	Then two CNNs are adopted to further evaluate the passed windows and the windows around.
method	A relatively deep model net-4 is applied to adjust the passed windows at last and the adjusted windows are regarded as final positions.
result	The experimental results show that our method can achieve real time detection at the rate of 14FPS and be robust with a small size of training data.
result	The detection accuracy is much higher than traditional methods and state-of-the-art methods.

result	We found that GSDMM can infer the number of clusters automatically with a good balance between the completeness and homogeneity of the clustering results, and is fast to converge.

background	When networking researchers meet the task of doing simulations, there is always a need to evaluate the value of such models by measuring a set of well known network performance metrics.
background	However, simulators in general and NS-3 in particular, require significant programming effort from the researcher in order to collect those metrics.
objective	This paper reports a contribution for NS-3 consisting of a new flow monitoring module that makes it easier to collect and save to persistent storage a common set of network performance metrics.
method	The module automatically detects all flows passing through the network and stores in a file most of the metrics that a researcher might need to analyze about the flow, such as bitrates, duration, delays, packet sizes, and packet loss ratio.
method	The value of this module is demonstrated using an easy to follow example.
method	It is also validated by comparing the measurements of a simple scenario with the expected values.
result	Finally, the performance of flow monitoring is characterized and shown to introduce small overheads.

background	Trigger-Action platforms are web-based systems that enable users to create automation rules by stitching together online services representing digital and physical resources using OAuth tokens.
background	Unfortunately, these platforms introduce a longrange large-scale security risk: If they are compromised, an attacker can misuse the OAuth tokens belonging to a large number of users to arbitrarily manipulate their devices and data.
method	We introduce Decentralized Action Integrity, a security principle that prevents an untrusted trigger-action platform from misusing compromised OAuth tokens in ways that are inconsistent with any given user’s set of trigger-action rules.
method	We present the design and evaluation of Decentralized Trigger-Action Platform (DTAP), a trigger-action platform that implements this principle by overcoming practical challenges.
method	DTAP splits currently monolithic platform designs into an untrusted cloud service, and a set of user clients (each user only trusts their client).
method	Our design introduces the concept of Transfer Tokens (XTokens) to practically use finegrained rule-specific tokens without increasing the number of OAuth permission prompts compared to current platforms.
result	Our evaluation indicates that DTAP poses negligible overhead: it adds less than 15ms of latency to rule execution time, and reduces throughput by 2.5%.

background	Forecasting the flow of crowds is of great importance to traffic management and public safety, and very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, such as inter-region traffic, events, and weather.
objective	We propose a deep-learning-based approach, called ST-ResNet, to collectively forecast the inflow and outflow of crowds in each and every region of a city.
method	We design an end-to-end structure of ST-ResNet based on unique properties of spatio-temporal data.
method	More specifically, we employ the residual neural network framework to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of crowd traffic.
method	For each property, we design a branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial properties of crowd traffic.
method	ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different weights to different branches and regions.
method	The aggregation is further combined with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the final traffic of crowds in each and every region.
result	Experiments on two types of crowd flows in Beijing and New York City (NYC) demonstrate that the proposed ST-ResNet outperforms six well-known methods.

background	The field of object detection has seen dramatic performance improvements in the last few years.
background	Most of these gains are attributed to bottom-up, feedforward ConvNet frameworks.
background	However, in case of humans, top-down information, context and feedback play an important role in doing object detection.
objective	This paper investigates how we can incorporate top-down information and feedback in the state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN framework.
method	Specifically, we propose to: (a) augment Faster RCNN with a semantic segmentation network; (b) use segmentation for top-down contextual priming; (c) use segmentation to provide top-down iterative feedback using two stage training.
result	Our results indicate that all three contributions improve the performance on object detection, semantic segmentation and region proposal generation.

background	Information systems development is a high-risk undertaking, and failures remain common despite advances in development tools and technologies.
background	In this paper, we argue that one reason for this is the collapse of organizational intelligence required to deal with the complexities of systems development.
background	Organizations fail to learn from their experience in systems development because of limits of organizational intelligence, disincentives for learning, organizational designs and educational barriers.
background	Not only have many organizations failed to learn, but they have also learned to fail.
background	Over time they accept and expect poor performance while creating organizational myths that perpetuate short-term optimization.
objective	This paper illustrates learning failure in systems development and recommends tactics for overcoming it.

background	Text in natural images is an important source of information, which can be utilized for many real-world applications.
objective	This work focuses on a new problem: distinguishing images that contain text from a large volume of natural images.
method	To address this problem, we propose a novel convolutional neural network variant, called Multi-scale Spatial Partition Network (MSP-Net).
method	The network classifies images that contain text or not, by predicting text existence in all image blocks, which are spatial partitions at multiple scales on an input image.
method	The whole image is classified as a text image (an image containing text) as long as one of the blocks is predicted to contain text.
method	The network classifies images very efficiently by predicting all blocks simultaneously in a single forward propagation.
result	Through experimental evaluations and comparisons on public datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

background	The basis of applying deep learning to solve natural language processing tasks is to obtain high-quality distributed representations of words, i.e., word embeddings, from large amounts of text data.
background	However, text itself usually contains incomplete and ambiguous information, which makes necessity to leverage extra knowledge to understand it.
background	Fortunately, text itself already contains welldefined morphological and syntactic knowledge; moreover, the large amount of texts on the Web enable the extraction of plenty of semantic knowledge.
background	Therefore, it makes sense to design novel deep learning algorithms and systems in order to leverage the above knowledge to compute more effective word embeddings.
objective	In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on the capacity of leveraging morphological, syntactic, and semantic knowledge to achieve high-quality word embeddings.
method	Our study explores these types of knowledge to define new basis for word representation, provide additional input information, and serve as auxiliary supervision in deep learning, respectively.
result	Experiments on an analogical reasoning task, a word similarity task, and a word completion task have all demonstrated that knowledge-powered deep learning can enhance the effectiveness of word embedding.

background	ABMS promises to have far-reaching effects on the way that businesses use computers to support decision-making and researchers use electronic laboratories to support their research.
background	Some have gone so far as to contend that ABMS "is a third way of doing science," in addition to traditional deductive and inductive reasoning (Axelrod 1997).

background	Convolutional Neural Networks define an exceptionally powerful class of models, but are still limited by the lack of ability to be spatially invariant to the input data in a computationally and parameter efficient manner.
objective	In this work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network.
method	This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process.
result	We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.

background	Knowing individuals' relational orientation is imperative for effective offline, as well as online, interactions and collaborations.
background	We use attachment theory to examine the link between Facebook users' relational orientation (in terms of attachment styles: anxiety and avoidance) and their relational activities.
objective	Our research examines whether and how the two key relational processes identified in offline social relationships (self-expression and responsiveness) are manifested on online social networks and related to attachment styles.
method	We describe our dataset of 640 Facebook users, their attachment scale survey results, and their 525,334 posts.
method	We define four features that map onto relational activities on Facebook: status updates and status updates with emotional words (self-expression); comments and likes (responsiveness).
result	We find significant relationships between the users' attachment styles and their self-expression and responsiveness activities on Facebook.
result	A key takeaway of our research is that without relying on self-reported surveys, a computational analysis of a Facebook user's self-expressing and responding activities alone can reveal the user's underlying relational orientation (i.e., attachment style).

background	Snakes, or active contours, are used extensively in computer vision and image processing applications, particularly to locate object boundaries.
background	Problems associated with initialization and poor convergence to concave boundaries, however, have limited their utility.
objective	This paper develops a new external force for active contours, largely solving both problems.
method	This external force, which we call gradient vector flow (GVF), is computed as a diffusion of the gradient vectors of a gray-level or binary edge map derived from the image.
result	The resultant field has a large capture range and forces active contours into concave regions.
result	Examples on simulated images and one real image are presented.

background	Sentiment analysis over Twitter offer organisations a fast and effective way to monitor the publics’ feelings towards their brand, business, directors, etc.
background	A wide range of features and methods for training sentiment classifiers for Twitter datasets have been researched in recent years with varying results.
objective	In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of adding semantics as additional features into the training set for sentiment analysis.
method	For each extracted entity (e.g. iPhone) from tweets, we add its semantic concept (e.g. “Apple product”) as an additional feature, and measure the correlation of the representative concept with negative/positive sentiment.
method	We apply this approach to predict sentiment for three different Twitter datasets.
result	Our results show an average increase of F harmonic accuracy score for identifying both negative and positive sentiment of around 6.5% and 4.8% over the baselines of unigrams and part-of-speech features respectively.
result	We also compare against an approach based on sentiment-bearing topic analysis, and find that semantic features produce better Recall and F score when classifying negative sentiment, and better Precision with lower Recall and F score in positive sentiment classification.

background	The trend toward physically dispersed work groups has necessitated a fresh inquiry into the role and nature of team leadership in virtual settings.
method	To accomplish this, we assembled thirteen culturally diverse global teams from locations in Europe, Mexico, and the United States, assigning each team a project leader and task to complete.
result	The findings suggest that effective team leaders demonstrate the capability to deal with paradox and contradiction by performing multiple leadership roles simultaneously (behavioral complexity).
result	Specifically, we discovered that highly effective virtual team leaders act in a mentoring role and exhibit a high degree of understanding (empathy) toward other team members.
result	At the same time, effective leaders are also able to assert their authority without being perceived as overbearing or inflexible.
result	Finally, effective leaders are found to be extremely effective at providing regular, detailed, and prompt communication with their peers and in articulating role relationships (responsibilities) among the virtual team members.
result	This study provides useful insights for managers interested in developing global virtual teams, as well as for academics interested in pursuing virtual team research.

background	In retail businesses, for example, forecasting demand is crucial for having the right inventory available at the right time at the right place.
method	In this paper we propose DeepAR, a methodology for producing accurate probabilistic forecasts, based on training an auto-regressive recurrent network model on a large number of related time series.

background	Unlike a univariate decision tree, a multivariate decision tree is not restricted to splits of the instance space that are orthogonal to the features' axes.
objective	This article addresses several issues for constructing multivariate decision trees: representing a multivariate test, including symbolic and numeric features, learning the coefficients of a multivariate test, selecting the features to include in a test, and pruning of multivariate decision trees.
method	We present several new methods for forming multivariate decision trees and compare them with several well-known methods.
method	We compare the different methods across a variety of learning tasks, in order to assess each method's ability to find concise, accurate decision trees.
result	The results demonstrate that some multivariate methods are in general more effective than others (in the context of our experimental assumptions).
result	In addition, the experiments confirm that allowing multivariate tests generally improves the accuracy of the resulting decision tree over a univariate tree.

background	We study the task of image inpainting, which is to fill in the missing region of an incomplete image with plausible contents.
objective	To this end, we propose a learning-based approach to generate visually coherent completion given a high-resolution image with missing components.
objective	In order to overcome the difficulty to directly learn the distribution of high-dimensional image data, we divide the task into initialization and texture-refinement as two separate steps and model each step with a deep neural network.
method	We also use simple heuristics to guide transferring of textures from boundary to the hole.
method	We show that, by using such techniques, inpainting reduces to the problem of learning two image-feature translation functions of much smaller dimensionality.
result	We evaluate our method on several public datasets and show that we not only generate results of comparable or better visual quality, but are orders of magnitude faster than previous state-of-the-art methods.

background	We consider the effect of imperfect separability in the received signals on the detection performance of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar with widely separated antennas.
background	The mutual orthogonality among the received signals is often assumed but cannot be achieved in practice for all Doppler and delay pairs.
method	We introduce a data model considering the correlation among the data from different transmitter-receiver pairs as unknown parameters.
method	Based on the expectation maximization algorithm, we propose a method to estimate the target, correlation, and noise parameters.
method	We then use the estimates of these parameters to develop a statistical decision test.
method	Employing the asymptotic statistical characteristics and the numerical performance of the test, we analyze the sensitivity of the MIMO radar with respect to changes in the cross-correlation levels of the measurements.
objective	We demonstrate the effect of the increase in the correlation among the received signals from different transmitters on the detection performance.

background	Cyberbullism, incitement to self-harm practices, sexual predation are just some of the severe effects of massive online offensives.
background	Moreover, attacks can be carried out against groups of victims and can degenerate in physical violence.
objective	In this work, we aim at containing and preventing the alarming diffusion of such hate campaigns.
objective	Using Facebook as a benchmark, we consider the textual content of comments appeared on a set of public Italian pages.
method	We first propose a variety of hate categories to distinguish the kind of hate.
method	Crawled comments are then annotated by up to five distinct human annotators, according to the defined taxonomy.
method	Leveraging morpho-syntactical features, sentiment polarity and word embedding lexicons, we design and implement two classifiers for the Italian language, based on different learning algorithms: the first based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the second on a particular Recurrent Neural Network named Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).
method	We test these two learning algorithms in order to verify their classification performances on the task of hate speech recognition.
result	The results show the effectiveness of the two classification approaches tested over the first manually annotated Italian Hate Speech Corpus of social media text.

background	We consider the problem of learning a sparse multi-task regression, where the structure in the outputs can be represented as a tree with leaf nodes as outputs and internal nodes as clusters of the outputs at multiple granularity.
objective	Our goal is to recover the common set of relevant inputs for each output cluster.
background	Assuming that the tree structure is available as prior knowledge, we formulate this problem as a new multi-task regularized regression called tree-guided group lasso.
method	Our structured regularization is based on a grouplasso penalty, where groups are defined with respect to the tree structure.
method	We describe a systematic weighting scheme for the groups in the penalty such that each output variable is penalized in a balanced manner even if the groups overlap.
method	We present an efficient optimization method that can handle a largescale problem.
result	Using simulated and yeast datasets, we demonstrate that our method shows a superior performance in terms of both prediction errors and recovery of true sparsity patterns compared to other methods for multi-task learning.

background	Multiplayer Online Games (MOGs) like Defense of the Ancients and StarCraft II have attracted hundreds of millions of users who communicate, interact, and socialize with each other through gaming.
background	In MOGs, rich social relationships emerge and can be used to improve gaming services such as match recommendation and game population retention, which are important for the user experience and the commercial value of the companies who run these MOGs.
objective	In this work, we focus on understanding social relationships in MOGs.
method	We propose a graph model that is able to capture social relationships of a variety of types and strengths.
method	We apply our model to real-world data collected from three MOGs that contain in total over ten years of behavioral history for millions of players and matches.
method	We compare social relationships in MOGs across different game genres and with regular online social networks like Facebook.
method	Taking match recommendation as an example application of our model, we propose SAMRA, a Socially Aware Match Recommendation Algorithm that takes social relationships into account.
result	We show that our model not only improves the precision of traditional link prediction approaches, but also potentially helps players enjoy games to a higher extent.

background	Question Answering (QA) systems over Knowledge Graphs (KG) automatically answer natural language questions using facts contained in a knowledge graph.
background	Simple questions, which can be answered by the extraction of a single fact, constitute a large part of questions asked on the web but still pose challenges to QA systems, especially when asked against a large knowledge resource.
background	Existing QA systems usually rely on various components each specialised in solving different sub-tasks of the problem (such as segmentation, entity recognition, disambiguation, and relation classification etc.).
method	In this work, we follow a quite different approach: We train a neural network for answering simple questions in an end-to-end manner, leaving all decisions to the model.
method	It learns to rank subject-predicate pairs to enable the retrieval of relevant facts given a question.
method	The network contains a nested word/character-level question encoder which allows to handle out-of-vocabulary and rare word problems while still being able to exploit word-level semantics.
result	Our approach achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end approaches that rely on an attention mechanism.

objective	We present a fast algorithm for computing approximate quantiles in high speed data streams with deterministic error bounds.
method	For data streams of size N where N is unknown in advance, our algorithm partitions the stream into sub-streams of exponentially increasing size as they arrive.
method	For each sub-stream which has a fixed size, we compute and maintain a multi-level summary structure using a novel algorithm.
method	In order to achieve high speed performance, the algorithm uses simple block-wise merge and sample operations.
result	Overall, our algorithms for fixed-size streams and arbitrary-size streams have a computational cost of O(N log(1/epsivlogepsivN)) and an average per-element update cost of O(log logN) if epsiv is fixed.

background	The logistic regression model is used to predict a binary response variable in terms of a set of explicative ones.
background	The estimation of the model parameters is not too accurate and their interpretation in terms of odds ratios may be erroneous, when there is multicollinearity (high dependence) among the predictors.
background	Other important problem is the great number of explicative variables usually needed to explain the response.
objective	In order to improve the estimation of the logistic model parameters under multicollinearity and to reduce the dimension of the problem with continuous covariates, it is proposed to use as covariates of the logistic model a reduced set of optimum principal components of the original predictors.
method	Finally, the performance of the proposed principal component logistic regression model is analyzed by developing a simulation study where different methods for selecting the optimum principal components are compared.

objective	One original contribution of our research is the formalization and theoretical foundation of the problem.
objective	But, in particular, we develop a co-occurrence probability informed search strategy for the problem.

background	Most current approaches for 3D object tracking rely on distinctive object appearances.
background	While several such trackers can be instantiated to track multiple objects independently, this not only neglects that objects should not occupy the same space in 3D, but also fails when objects have highly similar or identical appearances.
objective	In this paper we develop a probabilistic graphical model that accounts for similarity and proximity and leads to robust real-time tracking of multiple objects from RGB-D data, without recourse to bolton collision detection.

background	The volume of tissue activated (VTA) is a well-established approach to model the direct effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on neural tissue and previous studies have pointed to its potential clinical applications.
background	However, the elevated computational time required to estimate the VTA with standard techniques used in biological neural modeling limits its suitability for practical use.
objective	The goal of this project was to develop a novel methodology to reduce the computation time of VTA estimation.
objective	To that end, we built a Gaussian process emulator.
method	It combines a field of multi-compartment axon models coupled to the stimulating electric field with a Gaussian process classifier (GPC); following the premise that computing the VTA from a field of axons is in essence a binary classification problem.
result	We achieved a considerable reduction in the average time required to estimate the VTA, under both ideal isotropic and realistic anisotropic brain tissue conductive conditions, limiting the loss of accuracy and overcoming other drawbacks entailed by alternative methods.

background	125 years after Bertha Benz completed the first overland journey in automotive history, the Mercedes Benz S-Class S 500 INTELLIGENT DRIVE followed the same route from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany, in fully autonomous manner.
background	The autonomous vehicle was equipped with close-to-production sensor hardware and relied solely on vision and radar sensors in combination with accurate digital maps to obtain a comprehensive understanding of complex traffic situations.
background	The historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route is particularly challenging for autonomous driving.
background	The course taken by the autonomous vehicle had a length of 103 km and covered rural roads, 23 small villages and major cities (e.g. downtown Mannheim and Heidelberg).
background	The route posed a large variety of difficult traffic scenarios including intersections with and without traffic lights, roundabouts, and narrow passages with oncoming traffic.

background	One commonly used framework for developing and evaluating technology intensive information systems is CobiT. This framework was originally a benchmark of best control practices developed and maintained by the Information Technology Governance Institute, the umbrella organization to the Information Systems Audit and Control Association.
background	We empirically examine the conceptual model that underlies the CobiT internal control framework as it applies to an audit setting (including operational, compliance, and financial audit settings).
background	We find that superimposing CobiT's conceptual model onto audit relevant assessments made by a panel of highly experienced IT auditors confirms the internal consistency between the underlying constructs of CobiT. Furthermore, we find that CobiT's conceptual model predicts auditor behavior in the field related to their seeking help and giving help as evidenced by their postings to a general IT audit listserv.
result	Given the results of this study, we propose future research aimed at developing a general theory of internal control applicable to information technology based on CobiT. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

method	First, fruit images were acquired by a digital camera, and then the background of each image was removed by a split-and-merge algorithm; Second, the color histogram, texture and shape features of each fruit image were extracted to compose a feature space; Third, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensions of feature space; Finally, three kinds of multi-class SVMs were constructed, i.e., Winner-Takes-All SVM, Max-Wins-Voting SVM, and Directed Acyclic Graph SVM.
method	Meanwhile, three kinds of kernels were chosen, i.e., linear kernel, Homogeneous Polynomial kernel, and Gaussian Radial Basis kernel; finally, the SVMs were trained using 5-fold stratified cross validation with the reduced feature vectors as input.
result	The experimental results demonstrated that the Max-Wins-Voting SVM with Gaussian Radial Basis kernel achieves the best classification accuracy of 88.2%.
result	For computation time, the Directed Acyclic Graph SVMs performs swiftest.

background	As CMOS technologies have shrunk to tens of nanometers, aging problems have emerged as a major challenge.
background	There has been tremendous progress in developing new methods for modeling and diagnosing reliability at the level of individual transistors, but much less work on propagating these models to higher levels of abstraction to analyze and optimize the reliability of larger circuits.
result	This talk will provide an introduction to various circuit aging mechanisms and will then discuss research that develops computer-aided design techniques for estimating and enhancing the reliability of large digital circuits, examining solutions that could practically be applied to analyze or improve the lifetime of a design while maintaining consistency to accurate device-level models and the associated physics.

background	Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy remain a major challenge, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks.
background	Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices.
background	In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins.
background	Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home.
objective	In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier.
method	Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as “miner” that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home.
method	The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications.
method	We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
result	Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.

background	Exaggeration of facial expressions is used in animation and robotics to intensify emotions.
background	However, modifying a human-like face can lead to an unsettling outcome.
background	This phenomenon is known as uncanny valley.
objective	The goal of this study was to identify the realism level and magnitude of facial expression that produce the maximum amount of emotional intensity and the minimum amount of perceived strangeness.
method	We studied the perceived intensity of emotion and perceived strangeness of faces with varying levels of realism (from schematic to photorealistic) and magnitude of facial expressions (from neutral to extremely exaggerated).
result	We found that less realistic faces required more exaggeration to reach the emotional intensity of a real human face.
result	While there is a range of emotional intensity that can be expressed by real human faces (from neutral to full intensity), we found that the same range of emotional intensity could be expressed by artificial faces when exaggeration was used.
result	However, attempts to express emotional intensities outside this range using exaggeration led to strange-looking faces at all levels of realism.

background	The recent research on the CVRP is being slowed down by the lack of a good set of benchmark instances.
background	The existing sets suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (i) became too easy for current algorithms; (ii) are too artificial; (iii) are too homogeneous, not covering the wide range of characteristics found in real applications.
objective	We propose a new set of instances ranging from 100 to 1000 customers, designed in order to provide a more comprehensive and balanced experimental setting.
method	We report results with state-of-the-art exact and heuristic methods.

background	Many modern robotics applications require robots to function autonomously in dynamic environments including other decision making agents, such as people or other robots.
background	This calls for fast and scalable interactive motion planning.
background	This requires models that take into consideration the other agent's intended actions in one's own planning.
method	We present a real-time motion planning framework that brings together a few key components including intention inference by reasoning counterfactually about potential motion of the other agents as they work towards different goals.
method	By using a light-weight motion model, we achieve efficient iterative planning for fluid motion when avoiding pedestrians, in parallel with goal inference for longer range movement prediction.
method	This inference framework is coupled with a novel distributed visual tracking method that provides reliable and robust models for the current belief-state of the monitored environment.
method	This combined approach represents a computationally efficient alternative to previously studied policy learning methods that often require significant offline training or calibration and do not yet scale to densely populated environments.
result	We validate this framework with experiments involving multi-robot and human-robot navigation.
result	We further validate the tracker component separately on much larger scale unconstrained pedestrian data sets.

background	Architectural views are at the foundation of software architecture and are used to describe the system from different perspectives.
background	However, some architectural concerns crosscut the decomposition of the architecture in views.
background	The drawbacks of crosscutting with respect to architectural views is similar to the drawbacks with respect to code, i.e. hampering reuse, maintenance and evolution of the architecture.
objective	This paper investigates the relations between architectural concerns, architectural drivers and views to identify why crosscutting manifests itself.
method	We propose to extend the architectural description with slices and composition mechanisms to prevent this crosscutting and perform an initial exploration of these concepts in an Online Auction system.
result	Within this limited setting the first results look promising to better separate concerns that otherwise would crosscut the views.

objective	This paper describes an algorithm to compute the envelope of a set of points in a plane, which generates convex or non-convex hulls that represent the area occupied by the given points.
method	The proposed algorithm is based on a k-nearest neighbours approach, where the value of k, the only algorithm parameter, is used to control the “smoothness” of the final solution.
result	The obtained results show that this algorithm is able to deal with arbitrary sets of points, and that the time to compute the polygons increases approximately linearly with the number of points.

background	Recurrent neural networks are powerful sequence learners.
background	They are able to incorporate context information in a flexible way, and are robust to localised distortions of the input data.
background	These properties make them well suited to sequence labelling, where input sequences are transcribed with streams of labels.
background	Long short-term memory is an especially promising recurrent architecture, able to bridge long time delays between relevant input and output events, and thereby access long range context.
objective	The aim of this thesis is to advance the state-of-the-art in supervised sequence labelling with recurrent networks in general, and long short-term memory in particular.
method	Its two main contributions are (1) a new type of output layer that allows recurrent networks to be trained directly for sequence labelling tasks where the alignment between the inputs and the labels is unknown, and (2) an extension of long short-term memory to multidimensional data, such as images and video sequences.
result	Experimental results are presented on speech recognition, online and offline handwriting recognition, keyword spotting, image segmentation and image classification, demonstrating the advantages of advanced recurrent networks over other sequential algorithms, such as hidden Markov Models.

background	The purposes of this paper are to review the microinstruction sequencing capabilities of several microprogrammed computers; to determine whether these sequencing capabilities permit easy implementation of the control constructs of flowchartable program logic in modular microcode; and to present a set of microinstruction sequencing functions which will support "structured" microprogramming.
background	Several microprogrammable mini- and microcomputers which provide the user with the means for implementing special purpose instruction sets have been introduced relatively recently.
background	However, the experiments by Weber and Balzer which demonstrated the possibilities for increasing computation speeds, decreasing main memory space usage, and easing the task of applications programming by means of special purpose instruction sets implemented in microcode were performed some time ago.
